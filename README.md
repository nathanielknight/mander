# Mander

A game about [hacking democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering).

<a href="https://neganp.github.io/mander">Play</a> (Desktop only, no touch or mobile support).

This is my entry for
the
[2016 Github Game Off](https://github.com/github/game-off-2016). It's
written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) using SVG for the map and a
little CSS for styling; that's it!

Many thanks to my ever-understanding partner for being patient as I
disappeared into this project on weekends and gamely being my test
audience.
